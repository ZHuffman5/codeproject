         <h2>About:</h2>
         <p>
           <p>  Elon Musk is a South African American capitalist/buisness man. He was at one time the richest man in the world with a net worth of 219.9 billion USD. He is most well known for his company's Tesla and SpaceX. Although he is also (lesser) known for selling a "boring" flamethrower, his many twitter tweets, and the company neuralink.</p> 
           <p>  In 1995 Musk started his first project, Zip2. It was a searchable buisness directory. He and his brother then later added a map function. Finally in 1999 it was sold for $307 million.</p>
           <p>  Since then, Musk has started many compnay's/businesses. As mentioned above, the most well known of these are Tesla and SpaceX. With Tesla, he is hoping to create a world where electric cars are common and affordable. The goal of SpaceX is then to be the first commercial space company and hopes to get earth to mars in the near future.</p>
